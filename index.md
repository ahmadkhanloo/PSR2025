## Why join?
In research projects, we often end up with a lot of code that *works* — but no one (not even ourselves) can read or extend it later.  
Many researchers learn to code through trial and error, or rely on a developer to help them move their projects forward.  
This workshop is designed to fill that gap — to teach the essential coding and project organization skills that often get lost between science and software engineering.  
Everything is explained simply, at a level tailored for research work.

🎯 **Our goal:**  
To teach researchers the essential programming practices they need to code more clearly, independently, and professionally.

## What will I learn?
- A short Python refresher and research-oriented coding tips  
- Hands-on introduction to Git and version control  
- Clean code principles and modular project structure  
- Documentation and project maintenance  
- Data visualization and scientific plotting  
- Basics of turning your code into a shareable tool  
- Agile-style project management for research  
- A collaborative team project throughout the workshop  

## Who is it for? 👩‍🔬
Students and researchers who work with data and code
