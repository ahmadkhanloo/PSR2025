In cognitive science research, scripts often work only on the researcherâ€™s laptopâ€”hard to maintain, reproduce, or share.
This workshop is designed to change that.

Over three hands-on days, youâ€™ll learnâ€”with minimal technical complexityâ€”how to:

Manage your research code with Git and GitHub

Organize projects like a software team

Write clean, documented, and testable code

Collaborate effectively on shared cognitive science projects

ðŸŽ¯ The goal isnâ€™t to turn scientists into software engineers,
but to help them write clear, reusable, and trustworthy research code.

ðŸ‘¥ Who should attend:
Students and researchers in cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, or related fields who work with data, modeling, or behavioral tasks.

ðŸ§© Youâ€™ll gain practical skills in:

Version control and team collaboration

Modular design and documentation

Reproducible environments (Conda, venv)

Visualization and CI/CD basics

Group development of a real cognitive task project
